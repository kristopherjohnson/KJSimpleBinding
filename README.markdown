# KJSimpleBinding

`KJSimpleBinding` is a library that makes it easy to use [key-value coding](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Articles/KeyValueCoding.html) (KVC) and [key-value observing](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html) (KVO) for simple data-binding scenarios in iOS applications.

The library is inspired by Mac OS X's [Cocoa bindings](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaBindings/CocoaBindings.html) mechanisms, but only implements a small subset of that functionality. The data bindings provided by `KJSimpleBinding` are one-way only: that is, the library handles updating user-interface elements automatically when a model object's property changes, but changes to the UI element will not result in an automatic change to the model object.


## Contents

The following targets are provided in an Xcode workspace:

- `KJSimpleBinding` - a static library that provides the `KJBindingManager` class. You can copy this library into your own projects, or just copy the `.h` and `.m` file.
- `KJSimpleBindingTests` - unit tests for the `KJSimpleBinding` library. To run the tests, select the `KJSimpleBinding` scheme in Xcode and then choose the *Product* > *Test* menu item.
- `KJSimpleBindingDemo` - a simple iOS application that demonstrates use of `KJBindingManager`.


## Basic Usage of KJBindingManager

Typically you will make a binding manager an instance variable or property of a `UIViewController` subclass.  Create a `KJBindingManager` instance like this:

    _bindingManager = [[KJBindingManager alloc] init];
    
Set up bindings by calling the `-bindObserver:keyPath:toSubject:keyPath:` method.

    [_bindingManager bindObserver:myLabel       keyPath:@"text"
                        toSubject:myModelObject keyPath:@"stringProperty"];

In this example, the value of `myLabel.text` will be updated whenever `myModelObject.stringProperty` is set to a new value.

The observer must be [KVC-compliant](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Articles/Compliant.html) for the specified key path, and the subject must be [KVO-compliant](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/Articles/KVOCompliance.html) for the specified key path. 

The observer and subject properties must have compatible types; an attempt to bind a numeric property to a string property or vice versa will cause a runtime exception. (See the section on Value Transformations, below, to see how to work around this.)

Note that `-bindObserver:keyPath:toSubject:keyPath:` does not retain the observer or subject, so it is up to the caller to guarantee that those object references stay valid.

The binding manager must be _enabled_ before it will start performing the observation/update behavior.  It is recommended that it be enabled in the view controller's `viewWillAppear:` method, and then disabled in the `viewWillDisappear:` method, so that the overhead of observation applies only while the bound objects are onscreen:

    - (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {
        [super viewWillAppear:animated];
        [_bindingManager enable];
    }

    - (void)viewWillDisappear:(BOOL)animated {
        [_bindingManager disable];
        [super viewWillDisappear:animated];
    }

Call the `-removeAllBindings` method to remove the bindings.  It is good style to call this before releasing the binding manager, but it will automatically be done if the binding manager is deallocated while it has active bindings.

See the [KJSimpleBindingDemo](http://github.com/kristopherjohnson/KJSimpleBinding/blob/master/KJSimpleBindingDemo/ViewController.m) sample code for a complete example.


## Value Transformations

You can transform the value received from the source into another representation before setting the observer's value.  For example, you may need to convert a numeric value to a string, or may need to convert a boolean value to "On" or "Off".

You do this by specifying a _value-transformation_ block to `-bindObserver:keyPath:toSubject:keyPath:withValueTransform:`.

For example, if the subject exposes a numeric property, then that value will be an instance of `NSNumber`. If you try to assign that value to a `UILabel`'s `text` property, an exception will occur. So, we'll specify a value-transformation block that invokes `-stringValue` to convert the `NSNumber` to an `NSString`:

    [_bindingManager bindObserver:myLabel   keyPath:@"text"
                        toSubject:mySubject keyPath:@"numericProperty"
               withValueTransform:^(id value) { return [value stringValue]; }];


## ARC Support

The `master` branch does not support ARC. If you use the `KJBindingManager` class in an ARC project, you will need to add the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler option for `KJBindingManager.m`.

An experimental branch, `arc`, has the code from the `master` branch converted to ARC. It has not been extensively tested.



## Future Directions

There are no plans for further development of this library.  The author now recommends [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) for doing this kind of stuff.
